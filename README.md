more about practicing the logic behind something.
my execution is pretty poor but a learning step.
not able to find the bugs hidden on the given code
still going to answer the conceptual.md questions as I continue to study.
definitely not at the level I should be at this far in the course.
only thing i can do is continue and hope to reach the end.
knowing the syntax is easy, the logical part is the hard part.
